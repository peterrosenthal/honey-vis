# Honey Visualizer
This project is just a proof of concept for me so far. The goal is to use a game engine, in this case Godot, to make an interactive data visualizer for scientific research. The research this project is modeled after is a project I joined way back in May of 2018, and will be finished soon enough. Once that happens I might be able to look into including the data files in this repo (though they might be too large), but until that happens I definitely can't include the data here. Contact me directly if you're interested in compiling this project from source, and I can probably get you the data that drives the whole visualizer, without it the project won't work.
